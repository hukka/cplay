Description:

        cplay is a curses front-end for various audio players. It aims
        to provide a power-user-friendly interface with simple filelist
        and playlist control. cplay is written in Python and can use
        either pyncurses or the standard curses module.

Requirements:

    - python                  http://www.python.org/
    - pyalsaaudio (optional)  http://pyalsaaudio.sourceforge.net/
                                For Alsa mixer support
    - mutagen     (optional)  http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/
                                For metadata support (IDv3 etc.)
    - magic       (optional)  http://www.darwinsys.com/file/
                                For better filetype recognition

For playback either install mplayer (recommended): http://www.mplayerhq.hu/
or one or more of the following players:

    - mpg321                  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpg321/
    - ogg123                  http://www.vorbis.com/
    - mpg123                  http://www.mpg123.org/
    - splay                   http://splay.sourceforge.net/
    - madplay                 http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/
    - mikmod                  http://www.mikmod.org/
    - xmp                     http://xmp.sf.net/
    - sox                     http://sox.sf.net/
    - speex                   http://www.speex.org/

Installation:

        make install

Usage:

        cplay [-d <filename>] [-n] [-r] -[R] [ file | dir | playlist ] ...

        -d  Enable debugging output to <filename>.

        -n  Start in restricted mode: No shell commands, changing directory,
            goto, or saving playlists.

        -r  Start in repeat mode.

        -R  Start in random mode.


        When in doubt, press 'h' for a friendly help page.

Configuration:

        If you would like to change options passed to the actual players
        just edit the PLAYERS list in the cplay script or put the PLAYERS
        definition in either ~/.cplayrc or /etc/cplayrc. If one of these
        files is available, it is executed by cplay before initialization.

        Macros are defined using the MACRO dictionary, where the key is
        a key and the value is a string of cplay input. For example, the
        following would make ,d delete tagged (or current) files:

                MACRO['d'] = '!rm "$@"\n'

        Note, there is currently no version control for the rc-file!

Miscellaneous:

        A playlist can contain URLs, but the playlist itself will
        have to be local. For mpeg streaming, splay is recommended.

        It is also possible to pipe a playlist to cplay, as stdin
        will be reopened on startup unless it is attached to a tty.

        Remote control is available via /var/tmp/cplay_control-$USER.
        Create this with mkfifo and see lircrc for examples.

        The shell command gets the full path of either all tagged
        items or the current item as positional arguments.
